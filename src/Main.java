        Implement GUI:
             Board Display
             Dice Visual
             Card Display
             Property Display -- indicate Mortgaged or not
             Turn Announcement
             Pieces Visually
             Players Select Unique Pieces (different colours/shapes?)
             Money Visual
             Pieces Move


         GUI Logic:
            player can input amount of players
            player can input if they want to replay
            player can input name
            player can click to Roll, display a certain property, mortgage a property if owned
            click to buy/upgrade/downgrade/mortgage a property


        Logic:
            Bankruptcy
            Mortgaging Properties
            Selling Upgrades
            buying property
            pay rent
