            player can input amount of players -> PlayerManager ->constructor
            player can input if they want to replay -> up to you
            player can input name -> Player -> constructor
            player can click to Roll, display a certain property, mortgage a property if owned -> up to you
            click to buy/upgrade/downgrade/mortgage a property -> up to you


 todo       Logic:
            Mortgaging Properties -> Mortgage gives player 1/2 buy value <- can do at start of turn if wanted but forced to sell if money <0
            Selling Upgrades -> player gets half of upgrade  price <- can do at start of turn but forced to sell if money < 0
            buying property -> only upon landing on property
            pay rent -> upon landing no property
